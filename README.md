## Introduction

Pathogen-mongodb is a containerised MongoDB service that is launched through [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) is a NoSQL, document-oriented database program, which uses JSON-like array structures for storing data. Pathogen-mongodb uses the  [PyMongo](https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) python driver to communicate with the MongoDB database.

There are two containers in the docker-compose stack:

1) Containerised MongoDB program
2) Python container to run pathogen-mongodb.py program utilising PyMongo

The pathogen-mongodb.py python application imports output data from the PHW TB (CSV), UKHSA compass (CSV), and lodestone (JSON) pipelines into a MongoDB database, and can be used to create a comparison of the speciation and antimicrobial resistance results on a per run basis. The lodestone pipeline uses a more recent version of the NCBI taxonomy than the the other pipelines, therefore in order to make a comparison between the pipelines, a mapping file is used to map the pipelines to the same taxonomy.

To ensure persistence of data, the database files, pathogen-mongodb.py, and the pipeline output are stored locally and accessed by the containers through bind mounts.

There is bridge network between the two containers allowing communication between pathogen-mongodb.py and MongoDB.

## Usage
To start the docker-compose service
```
docker-compose up -d
```
To check status of service
```
user@name:~/pathogen-mongodb$ docker ps -a

To run pathogen-mongodb.py use docker exec
```
user@name:~/pathogen-mongodb$ docker exec -it pymongo bash
root@1ecdc6758c1c:/# cd data/app/
root@1ecdc6758c1c:/data/app# python3 pathogen-mongodb.py -h
usage: pathogen-mongodb.py [-h] [-l LODESTONEDIR] [-p PHWDIR] [-u UKHSADIR] [-c]

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -l LODESTONEDIR, --lodestone-dir LODESTONEDIR
                        Output directory from lodestone run
  -p PHWDIR, --phw-dir PHWDIR
                        Output directory for PHW results
  -u UKHSADIR, --ukhsa-dir UKHSADIR
                        Output directory for UKHSA results
  -c, --tb-csv          Create output csv
```
To spin down docker-compose
```
docker-compose down
```
